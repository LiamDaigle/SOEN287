        <h2>Feeding/Hydrating</h2>
        <p>
            "There are several ways to estimate how much water an individual dog needs, and this tend to vary due to individual circumstances.
            In general, dogs should drink approximately 1 ounce of water (1/8 of a cup) per pound of body weight each day. However, there are many factors that can affect how much your dog will drink, so you should not be restricting your dog’s water intake.
            Unless directed by your veterinarian, it’s not necessary to measure out the exact water amounts your pet drinks. Just make sure that your dog has plenty of fresh, clean water every day." <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/evr_dg_the_importance_of_water">(PetMD)</a>

            "Domesticated dogs are largely carnivores that eat some omnivorous foods.1 Dr Leigh from Your Vet Online advises that it is important to ensure your dog’s food is both complete and balanced for its stage of life, and if it has any medical issues.
            It is entirely acceptable to feed your dog a pure kibble diet. Or you can mix their diet up with some cooked or raw meat, fish, vegetables and rice.
            Many owners like to feed a raw meat diet to their dogs, and while this can suit some dogs very well, there are some important considerations you need to be aware of. Experienced vet Dr Leigh Davidson suggests the following." <a href="https://www.rspcapetinsurance.org.au/pet-care/dog-care/what-should-feed-dog#:~:text=It%20is%20entirely%20acceptable%20to,need%20to%20be%20aware%20of">(RSPCAPetInsurance)</a>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            "In general, most dogs should get one to two hours of exercise daily to help keep them healthy.
             Your dog may need more or less depending on age, breed, and tolerance.
             A senior Shih Tzu may just want to loaf around on the sofa while an adult Border Collie, Rhodesian ridgeback, or Bluetick Coonhound might be doing agility for four hours a day and still want more.
             No two dogs are the same, so discovering your dog’s exercise needs may require some trial and error.
             When in doubt, give your dog as much exercise as she wants, but be careful not to overdo it." <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/great-ways-to-exercise-with-dogs-1117865">(TheSprucePets)</a>

        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>
            "While good hygiene habits are essential for a healthy dog, unlike humans, most dogs do not require daily hygiene and grooming habits.
             What is required, and how often, depends on the breed.
             The Afghan Hound, Poodle, and Komondor — just to name a few — require regular grooming (but are certainly worth the effort), whereas breeds such as the Beagle, Weimaraner, and Boxer allow a bit more freedom in the grooming department.
             Hygiene such as teeth brushing, ear cleaning, nail trimming, and brushing are most certainly an essential aspect of regular dog care, regardless of the breed." <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-groom-a-dog/">(AKC)</a>
