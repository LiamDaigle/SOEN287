        <h2>Feeding/Hydrating</h2>
        <p>
            "Pets need constant access to clean water. Water should be changed at least once daily.
            Keep your pet’s bowl full and make sure to fill with fresh water every single day.
            It’s also important to keep your pet’s water bowl clean.
            Microbes from your pet’s saliva can be transferred to the water bowl, encouraging the growth of bacteria.
            You should wipe your pet’s bowl dry each day before refilling it with clean water.
            Every few days, wash your pet’s bowl with hot soapy water, or more if necessary.
            Choose stainless steel, porcelain or glass bowls over plastic.
            If you use a fountain to keep your pet hydrated, make sure to clean it at least once a week and regularly replace the fountain filters." <a href="https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/blog/how-often-should-you-change-your-pets-water#:~:text=Pets%20need%20constant%20access%20to,fresh%20water%20every%20single%20day">(WellnessPetFood)</a>

            "Cats need meat — you shouldn't feed them a vegetarian diet.
             They also need a good balance of fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids, which are building blocks for protein.
             Cats' dietary needs change with age and health." <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/cats/what-do-cats-eat">(Pets.WebMD)</a>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            "Exercise is important to your cat’s overall health.
             Movement, especially the kind that uses their hunting skills, can keep their weight down and help them work off extra energy.
             Playtime is crucial for their mental well-being, too -- it can help stop depression and boredom, which can lead to bigger health and behavior issues." <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/cats/cat-exercise">(Pets.WebMD)</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>
            "Brushing your cat not only removes dirt, grease and dead hair from her coat, but it helps to remove skin flakes and stimulates blood circulation, improving the overall condition of her skin.
             One or two brushings per week will help kitty to keep her healthy glow—and you’ll find that regular sessions are especially beneficial when your cat ages and is no longer able to groom so meticulously on her own." <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-grooming-tips">(ASPCA)</a>
